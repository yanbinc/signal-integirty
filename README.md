# Signal-Integirty

#This is site for study & exchange signal-integrity knowledege.


Python/Matlab coding for signal integrity issue over 30 projects.
Including:

1.  Tx-FIR tap optimization(ZF,MMSE).
2.  Pos/neg step/pulse response analysis tran&statistic.
3.  Worst pattern generation (PDA). (w/xtalk- pending.)
4.  DFE tap optimization(edge & center).
5.  NLTV system worst pattern searching.
6.  Pattern generation(eg.PAM4_8B5Q)..etc...
7.  ADS simulation result data process ï¼ˆds file merge/edit).
8.  Eye diagram centering .auto-measure EH/EW & setup/hold time.
9.  Touchstone file analysis . Causality Check/mixed-mode/merge.
10. Time domain and frequency domain transfer. (hilbert)
11. PSIJ analysis.
12. ibis-AMI model validation.
13. RSM analysis (stepwise pending.collate JMP backward 1st result well.)
14. IBIS file VI/VT curve plot and Zout calc.(Zout Calc)
15. tek wfm file read(base on tek library)
16. tr0 file read.(old version. based on cpp sim library)
17. data scrambling method.

Any suggestion and feedback?
